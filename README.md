This repository contains the open-source uptime monitor and status page for [Aurélien Ooms](https://aurelienooms.be), powered by [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime).

[![Response Time CI](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime/workflows/Response%20Time%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Response+Time+CI%22)
[![Graphs CI](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime/workflows/Graphs%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Graphs+CI%22)
[![Static Site CI](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime/workflows/Static%20Site%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Static+Site+CI%22)

With [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org), you can get your own unlimited and free uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by a GitHub repository. We use [Issues](https://github.com/aureooms/monitor/issues) as incident reports, [Actions](https://github.com/aureooms/monitor/actions) as uptime monitors, and [Pages](https://aureooms.github.io/monitor) for the status page.
